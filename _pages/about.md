=====
I am now a PH.D student in [School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science](https://saids.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hu Ding](https://hu-ding.github.io/) of DIAG Group from [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/mainm.htm). My research interests lie in the fields of **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**, with a focus on developing **efficient** and **robust** vision algorithms. I'm particularly interested in topics such as:

- Coreset
- Adversarial Training
- Continual Learning
