Biography
=====
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [School of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science](https://saids.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm) at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hu Ding](https://hu-ding.github.io/) from the DIAG Group, [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/mainm.htm). 

My research interests lie in the fields of Computer Vision and Generative Models, with a particular focus on designing **efficient** and **robust** algorithms. Specifically, I am interested in the following areas:

- Coreset
- Adversarial Training
- Continual Learning
- Diffusion Model


For more information, please refer to my [CV](../files/cv.pdf).
