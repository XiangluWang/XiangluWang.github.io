**Algorithms and Theory** is one of the core areas of computer science. With the advent of the era of big data, traditional algorithmic theories are no longer sufficient to address the practical challenges arising in fields such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and industrial manufacturing.

This course focuses on introducing novel algorithmic techniques designed for large-scale data, including **random sampling**, **dimensionality reduction**, **data compression**, **distributed computing**, **stream computing**, **clustering**, **classification**, and **stochastic optimization**. In addition, it covers relevant theoretical foundations and mathematical tools such as **probabilistic computation methods**, **VC-dimension**, **communication complexity**, as well as foundational topics in **machine learning** and **deep learning theory**.

As a theoretically-oriented course, it aims to equip students with the algorithmic and theoretical tools necessary to tackle problems in the big data era, thereby laying a solid foundation for engineering practices in related domains.
